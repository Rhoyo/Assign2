      I faced some challenges along the way and I did have to google some things.
      what was the most challenging part was fixing the gimmicky things. For example
      the input box and changing specifically the textarea background color. I solved
      these problems by googling of course. However, searching and finding the right
      answer served to be tedious at times. Some users would suggest using outline: 0
      but it did not fix my problem. Eventually I found the answer on stack overflow.

      I learned quite a bit in this assignment. CSS is truly a hands on learning type
      of thing. I believe however, That Robin really did set us up to learn css very well.
      It is like he gave us the keys and showed us the general lay out but only we could
      drive the car. That was really helpful however, and really guided me throughout the
      assignment.

      I specifically used a lot of Stack overflow as well as read the class Piazza. I liked
      how some of the more advanced CS 290 students helped the less advanced ones. That really
      helped me through this assignment as well. My class notes also helped to guide me in the
      beginning but after that it was definitely Piazza and other online resources as well as
      lecture notes.

      I had to google how to edit the search box as well as edit buttons. I was stuck on
      simple prospect of changing the size of the bullhorn for some reason. But i did end up
      figuring it out.
